In this repository I have added my projects/tasks I had performed during my LGMVIP-Web Development Internship 2022.

During this Web Development Internship we were having 3 levels of tasks:

Beginner Level(Two Tasks)

Intermediate Level(Two Tasks)

Advance Level(One Task)

Happy:) that I’ve completed my 4 tasks:-

Task 1(Beginner Level Task): We need to create a todo list using HTML, CSS ,JavaScript and reactjs. This task is to determine the basic understanding of front-end web designing with HTML, CSS ,JavaScript &reactjs skills along.

Task 2(Beginner level Task): We need to create a web application using create-react-app. In this, we need to make our own UI Design, we need to create a navbar and in that navigation bar we need to mention the brand name and a button name “Get Users”.

So, as soon as we click on that button, it will fetch & load all the data of the users from the given API and then display user name, photo and mail id in the form of user card grid layout.

Task 3(Intermediate level Task):We need to create a registration form whose data display on the same page using HTML,CSS & Javascript or reactjs.
